I'll help you understand how standardization (also called Standard Scaling or Z-score normalization) works step by step.

Let's break down the formula and calculate it manually for your temperature data:

The formula for standardization is:
```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```
Where:
- Z is the standardized value
- X is the original value
- μ (mu) is the mean of the data
- σ (sigma) is the standard deviation of the data

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the mean (μ):
```python
mean = (15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40) / 6
mean = 27.5
```

2. Then, calculate the standard deviation (σ):
   - Find the difference from mean for each value
   - Square these differences
   - Find their average (variance)
   - Take the square root
```python
differences = [15-27.5, 20-27.5, 25-27.5, 30-27.5, 35-27.5, 40-27.5]
# = [-12.5, -7.5, -2.5, 2.5, 7.5, 12.5]

squared_diff = [(-12.5)², (-7.5)², (-2.5)², 2.5², 7.5², 12.5²]
# = [156.25, 56.25, 6.25, 6.25, 56.25, 156.25]

variance = (156.25 + 56.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 56.25 + 156.25) / 6
# = 72.92

standard_deviation = √72.92 ≈ 8.54
```

3. Now we can standardize each value using (X - μ) / σ:

For X = 15:
```
(15 - 27.5) / 8.54 = -12.5 / 8.54 ≈ -1.46
```

For X = 20:
```
(20 - 27.5) / 8.54 = -7.5 / 8.54 ≈ -0.88
```

And so on...

The complete standardized values are:
- 15 → -1.46
- 20 → -0.88
- 25 → -0.29
- 30 → 0.29
- 35 → 0.88
- 40 → 1.46

Key properties of standardized data:
1. The mean of standardized data is always 0
2. The standard deviation is always 1
3. The distribution shape remains the same

This is why in your output, you see both positive and negative values centered around 0. It's particularly useful when:
- You want to compare features that are on different scales
- You're using algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of features (like neural networks or SVM)
- You want to compare data points across different datasets

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?
